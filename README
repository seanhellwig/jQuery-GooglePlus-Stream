jQuery Google Plus Public Stream Widget
please see /index.html for actual implementation.

source (development) files are located in /src/*
to build a release version:
cd {project path}
make
(this minifies the files in src/*/*) 


ps: any init (config.* vars) can be overridden in the plugin constructor, ie:
$('#tpmgps-widget-container').TMGplusStream({
    'USER_ID': '110031535020051778989', // hey this is my gPlus user id
    'API_KEY' : 'AIzaSyA4axePa6_b-OsuZq2Cm-JG3Up0njuv9Xw' // PLEASE CREATE YOUR OWN API KEY at, https://code.google.com/apis/console/ 
});
